# end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression
In this notebook, a machine learning model is created with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. 
This project was evaluated with the Root Mean Square Log Error (RMSLE), where a 0.241 value was accomplished. 
This was done through the employment of the CatBoostRegressor model.
